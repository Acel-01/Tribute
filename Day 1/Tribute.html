            Gates is the Co-founder of Microsoft, pioneer of first
            the PC-DOS, MS-DOS and then the line of Windows 
            operating systems used worldwide. He has been the

            From Bill's popular quotes, you'll easily notice that 
            he is a man doesn't dwell on success or loudmouthed 
            about his wealt, but is someone always looking out
            for his mistakes or failure with the mindset of 
            learning from them. Gates is a philanthropist to the
            latter always willing to help the poor, sick and needy.
            He with his wife started the "Bill and Melinda Gates 
            foundation" which today is the biggest charity 
            foundation today. In June 2006, he transitioned to a 
            part-time role at his multi-billionaire company, 
            Microsoft so he could work full-time at the private 
            charitable foundation he opened with his wife in the 
            year 2000.

            Some, if not most look at Bill Gates today and believe 
            his life was a smooth drive with no potholes here and 
            there but every influential person today has had a 
            taste of failure and that's just a fact that need not 
            be argued. Bill suffered bullying from his mates when
            he was younger cause he had a small stature compared to
            his peers. Also, he has faced rejection from companies 
            while applying to build softwares for them.

            Up till now, you've read more about who William Henry 
            Gates III is and less about the impact he has made on 
            me and how he has influenced my life choices. It may be
            true that we haven't met before, he probably doesn't 
            even know I exist, but his works alone inspired my 
            desire to delve into the software world. Developing 
            applications,games, web applications, websites, etc 
            became something I wanted to at least have I idea 
            about because of him and this decision had been made 
            since I was in JSS1. Seeing the applications Microsoft 
            made more popular over time, solve real life problems,
            encourages me to go on, push forward, and keep learning
            even when I feel tired with the hope that I can do 
            something better, contribute my own quota to make life 
            easier for everyone.

            Over time, I have chosen to take programming courses to 
            aid me in this path. One of them is choosing to learn 
            Front end developement under Engineering Career Expo 
            also known as ECX.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the years count on, I hope to be a full time 
            specialist in the field of Artificial Intelligence 
            and Machine Learning and also contribute to the 
            betterment of humanity.
